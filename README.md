# Not-Word2Vec
This is not word2vec.

Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) implementation of word embedding algorithm as described by https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2017/10/18/stop-using-word2vec/

Implementation is "by-hand" -- avoids using standard NLP tools such as those found in `NLTK`, `gensim`, `scikit-learn`, because what fun would that be?

To run unit tests:
```
$ python -m unittest discover -v tests
```
